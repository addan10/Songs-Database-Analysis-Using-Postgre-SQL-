# Songs-Database-Analysis-Using-Postgre-SQL-

This project explores a music database using PostgreSQL and answers a series of business-focused questions through SQL queries. It’s designed to demonstrate skills in JOIN operations, aggregations, filtering, and data-driven insights — particularly for use cases in customer and music analytics.
